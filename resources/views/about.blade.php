    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Early Life and Childhood</h2>
    <p>Virat Kohli, born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, hails from a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer, while his mother, Saroj Kohli, was a dedicated housewife. Kohli grew up in Uttam Nagar with an older brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna. His early education began at Vishal Bharti Public School.
From a tender age of three, Kohli displayed a remarkable inclination towards cricket. Armed with a bat, he showcased innate skill, often requesting his father to bowl to him. In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WCDA) was established, becoming a pivotal point in Kohli's cricketing journey. His father, recognizing his son's fervor, facilitated a meeting with Rajkumar Sharma, the academy's coach. Initially perceived as just another enthusiastic boy, Kohli quickly impressed Sharma with his accuracy and power in throwing.
Despite facing challenges, such as being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team due to extraneous factors, Kohli's father resisted offers from influential clubs. Instead, he aimed for his son to earn recognition based on merit, challenging the prevalent nepotism in the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA). Eventually, Kohli found his place in the under-15 Delhi team, receiving training at the WCDA and participating in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy.</p>

His talent was immediately apparent, and he quickly became a regular in the limited-overs format.ransitioning to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education, Kohli's dedication to cricket led him to travel long distances with his father to never miss a match. His skills evolved, earning respect from local bowlers. Tragedy struck on December 18, 2006, with the sudden demise of Kohli's father due to a cerebral attack. His father, a crucial supporter of his cricketing journey, left a significant void.

Despite the loss, Kohli's cricketing journey continued to thrive. His family, initially residing in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar, relocated to Gurgaon in 2015. Kohli's commitment to the sport, shaped by early experiences and family support, laid the foundation for his future as one of the cricketing world's most prominent figures.</p>
